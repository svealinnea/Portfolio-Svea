    <h2>More About Me: </h2>
    <p>I recently decided to quit my job and join Epicodus. I wanted to joing a coding bootcamp because I have always had an interest in being in the tech industry. There seems to be so much community, pride in work and love of work. I was working in Real Estate on a systems team before joining and I just felt as though I had done all that I could at that job and it was time to move on. The timing worked out perfectly and so here I am! My mantra has been to do the best I can today and strive to do better tomorrow!</p>
