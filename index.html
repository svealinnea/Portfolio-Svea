        <p>Hello, welcome to my portfolio. I wanted to start out by giving you a little background on me. I recently decided to quit my job and join <strong>Epicodus</strong>. Before I decided to quit my job, I had worked in the Real Estate industry for 5 years. I enjoyed the culture and the people at the company that I worked for but I just felt like I had created a skillset for myself that would not translate into any other industries. I had a conversation with someone I loved and they mentioned that I needed to create a skillset for myself that would make me a valuable employee. The first industry that I thought of joining was the Tech Industry, it just made sense that it would be the best industry to grow my skillset in. Tech doesnâ€™t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon so I decided make the plunge. It was scary and unknown but the way it worked out makes me believe it was the right decision to make. My mantra for code school has been to <em>try my best today and strive to be better tommorow!</em> I hope you enjoy the rest of my page and that you are able to learn a little bit more about who Svea is :).</p>
